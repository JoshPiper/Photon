# Contributor Guidelines

These guidelines have been written to ensure that code, issues and pull requests are to a good standard;
allowing for easier maintence and implementation.

## General

We're not looking for new components or sirens, unless there's an overwhelming reason to add them (such as being an example of a new feature).

## Code

### Style

Code should follow the style outlined in [Limelight Standards Document #1](https://github.com/limelight-development/standards/blob/master/lsd-1/readme.adoc).

### License

Contributors agree to their code being published under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial Attribution license and the Steam Workshop T&C.

## Pull Requests

- Pull requests should be titled meaningfully.
- PRs should focus on one main feature or change each.
- PRs should target development branch, not master.

## Issues

- Issues should have meaningful titles.
- Each issue should focus on one feature or issue.
- Issues should be appropriately labelled (feature / enhancement / bug / library)
